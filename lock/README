The lock is a simple terminal command that encrypts a file with the XOR algorithm with the given key.

In order to work properly you'll need to specify 2 flags.

1) -file
The absolute path to the file

2) -key
The key to encrypt the file with


Further there is one optional flag that you could specify

1) -overw
This flag takes either a 1 or 0. If set to 1 it will overwrite the current file with the encrypted data.

otherwise the default behavior is to create a new file in the same directory but the file is suffixed with "xor"


Use example:

lock -file="/Users/sometext.txt" -key="test"
