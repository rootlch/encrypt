This package provide 2 things.

1) A go lib to encrypt data with the XOR algorithm.

2) A terminal command called lock to encrypt any file with the given key.
Running lock on an encrypted file with the correct key will decrypt it.
(Note: If you've forgotten the key it is highly unlikely that you will be able to decrypt the file.)
